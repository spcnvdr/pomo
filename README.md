# Pomo - A simple Pomodoro Timer in React

This is my first attempt at learning React. This is meant to be a simple 
Pomodoro timer and was created with the 'create-react-app' command. The 
Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo 
in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a kitchen timer to break work into ntervals, 
typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app lets you 
configure the length of the work interval, the length of the rest interval, 
and whether or not to play a sound at the end of an interval. I am not a web 
designer or developer so the interface and code needs work.
